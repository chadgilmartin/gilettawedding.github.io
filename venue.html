			<h1>The Venue</h1>
			<p>All of the events of the weekend will be held at <a href="http://www.campkr.com/">Camp Kinder Ring & Circle Lodge</a>. It is a sleepaway summer camp for kids and retirement retreat center for adults. It has a lake, many sports fields, heated pool (which will be open on Saturday!), a theater, and a huge lodge which is more than large enough to shelter all of our shenanigans. It is also a non-profit, which was a big draw for us.</p></br></br>
			<h3>How do I get there?</h3>
			<p><strong>By Train:</strong> Take the Metro North - Hudson Line (the green one) to the New Hamburg stop. A shuttle to the camp can be arranged for a cost of $15 from this station (round trip).</p></br>

			<p><strong>By Air:</strong> There are two small airports very close to the site. The closest is Stewart International Airport, which is the best option if you are planning to rent a car, as it is just a 30 minute drive to the summer camp from there. The second is Westchester (White Plains) Airport, which is a little farther but is linked to the metro north rail line (see above) so is the best option for avoiding car rental. The three New York City airports (Newark, John F. Kennedy, and La Guardia) also link to the same rail line, but will take much longer and are each about a 90 minute drive from the camp.</p></br>

			<p><strong>By Car:</strong> Honestly, we don’t know, but our GPS does, and we bet yours does too! Here’s the address: 335 Sylvan Lake Rd, Hopewell Junction, New York, 12533. (In all seriousness, the camp is not far off of Interstate 84, and <a href="http://www.campkr.com/contact-us/visit-camp-kinder-ring">driving directions can be found here</a>.)</p></br></br>

			<h3>Where can I stay?</h3>

			<p>Our hope is that most of our guests will stay on site so that we can spend as much time as possible with all of you lovely folks. There are two housing options on site: (1) Hotel rooms with a single and a double bed, a private bathroom, A/C, heat, and standard hotel linens/toiletries, or (2) Hostel-style dorms with shared bathrooms and single beds. All on-site reservations can be made through the camp director once invitations have been sent out, and the registration process will be detailed in your invitation. We’ve planned a full weekend menu, which will be included in the price of all on-site housing.</p></br>

			</p>Unfortunately, housing on site is not limitless, so if the hotel rooms get over-booked, we will have to give priority to out-of-town guests. You can help us out by considering staying in the hostel-style housing, which will be substantially cheaper than the hotel rooms, or buddying-up and sharing a hotel room with a friend.</p></br>

<!--			<p>If you decide you want a little personal space, there are also some hotels and campgrounds nearby:

			<p>Please note that if you choose to stay off-site, you may have to pay extra to join meals other than the reception. You will also be responsible for transporting yourself to and from the venue.</p></br></br>
