			<h1>Our Vision</h1>
			<p>The way we see it, our wedding is a rare opportunity to bring the people we love most into a single place. It seems a shame to do all that work for just a few hours of fun, so we are extending the festivities throughout a whole weekend. We chose our venue with this vision in mind: Camp Kinder Ring & Circle Lodge provides a whole host of activities for us to share in during our weekend "destination summer camp" wedding. We hope that each of our guests will join us for as much of the weekend as they can manage.</p></br>
			<p>We also hope to create a wedding weekend that expresses who we are as individuals and as a couple. We are Quakers, so our ceremony will follow the tradition of the Religious Society of Friends. We are big nerds, so we are looking to throw in as many sci-fi, literature, and gaming references as we can muster. We are not particularly traditional, so we'll be foregoing the "to have and to hold" for a handfasting and leaving out some other traditions that we would only be doing because "that's what supposed to happen at a wedding." Most importantly, we love the many communities that we are a part of, so we're trying to create a welcoming environment that fosters the interweaving of those many social circles.</p>
